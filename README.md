# How does TypeScript help in improving code quality and project maintainability?

### Introduction

As TypeScript has grown in popularity, developers have embraced it for its type safety, scalability, and powerful tooling in modern web applications. Whether you’re a beginner or an advanced developer, refining your TypeScript skills can make a significant difference in your codebase's quality, maintainability, and readability. This guide will walk you through practical tips and best practices to help you write better TypeScript code.

### Why we need to improve TypeScript code more seriously

So there are many built-in solutions in TypeScript in Script which will help you to write bug-free code easily. You need to know these countries and use them in the right way. If we can use them all properly, our journey will become easier.

- ##### Bug reduction : TypeScript helps in catching bugs very quickly while compiling, thus avoiding many errors or bugs at run time.

- ##### High-quality code: TypeScript code is of very high quality and very clean code is easy to observe and very easy to understand.

- ##### Makes collaboration easy: You can easily collaborate in TypeScript at any time. Since TypeScript has its own code structure instructions, developers' code can be easily understood, so collaboration is easy.

### 1.Leverage Strict Typing Options

The TypeScript compiler gives you a much higher level of type checking. Setting "strict": true in your tsconfig.json is a great starting point, but there are additional alternatives that can be even better, such as

- noImplicitAny
- strictNullChecks
- strictFunctionTypes

### 2.Use Types and Interfaces Wisely

Use types and interfaces well. By using interfaces, you can easily understand the types of object properties, which will help you take the next step. Type and use them immediately.

### 3.Prefer unknown Over any

It is much better to use unknown type than any type because using any type usually ruins the essence of typisty, so use unknown type well, it will make it easier to do well.

### 4.Use Readonly and Immutable Types for Safety

Use read only and imu tables. It provides type safety and helps your code from any kind of rewriting. It has many benefits. It is reflected step by step.

### 5.Define Utility Types for Reusability

TypeScript has some built-in functionalities and utilities that, if used, will greatly reduce your coding time and greatly help in making your code more responsive.

### 6.Define Return Types Explicitly

Remember that if you specify the return type, the typing will understand how the function should work, meaning when it takes input, it will understand the input better and will be able to easily output it error-free.

### 7.Handle Null and Undefined Safely

Null and untifine are actually good, use them well. We know there is a null operator in TypeScript, so handle null and untifine with that. The code will be easier.

### 8.Utilize Enum for Meaningful Values

Use the concept called enum in typing scripts. Using enum will create a set of constants that will help you use unexpected numbers or strings. Try to use it a lot.

### 9.Use never for Exhaustive Checks

Try to work exhaustively with the never type. The never type does not return anything, but in many cases, using it can give you ideas for different solutions, so try to use the never type correctly.

### 10.Keep Functions Pure and Concise

When you use a function, try to make every point of the function very clear and every type correct, so that your function works at a much purer level. So, whenever you use a function, try to use a meaningful function name and use as short a logic as possible, so that the function runs easily.

### Conclusion

The world of TypeScript is vast, so if you want to explore it further, you need to give enough dedication and research time. You have learned about some of the above topics, I hope these will help you in your development journey at least a little. If you want, you can know better. Technology is constantly being updated from different platforms and programming languages ​​are constantly being updated with technology, so always stay updated with technology.

# Difference between any, unknown, and never types in TypeScript.

### Introduction

To understand TypeScript well, you need to have a good idea about its types. Many of us are a little worried about types. Especially for beginners. Usually there is a lot of confusion about these three major types, Never, unknown, any types. And due to not using these three types correctly, we write a lot of mistakes. This blog will give you a clear idea of ​​the difference between these three.

### Any Type:

Any type is a type system in TypeScript. Using this, you can use any type, there is no specific one, and TypeScript will not assume any type. You can give any value.

- #### Example:

```ts
let anyting: any = 5;
anyting = "Hello";
anyting = true;
anyting.doSometing();
```

### Unknown Type:

Anonymous type is a very useful type in TypeScript. By using anonymous type, you get type safety and it will not return anything until you are sure what the type of your variable is.

- #### Example:

```ts
let notSure: unknown = "typescript";
if (typeof notSure == "string") {
  console.log(notSure.toUpperCase());
}
```

### Never Type:

Never type is a hard type of typescript. Usually, never type will never return anything. Usually, when throwing a custom error, never type has to be used. And sometimes, infinity greed is activated, which never returns anything. In that case, labor type never type is used.

- #### Example:

```ts
funciton throwError(message:string):never{
    return new Error(massage);
}
function infiniteloop():never {
    whil(trure){}
}
```

### Conclusion

Type validation in TypeScript is very important, so we have to be very aware of it so that we can easily utilize our codes properly, especially at the production level. To avoid errors at the production level, we have to think about these types well at the development level.

### Call to Action

So, do you want your code project gulo to be well maintained in these three types, then understand the information well and apply it now. If you like my post, please don't forget to give feedback.
