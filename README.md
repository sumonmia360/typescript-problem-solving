# How does TypeScript help in improving code quality and project maintainability?

### Introduction

As TypeScript has grown in popularity, developers have embraced it for its type safety, scalability, and powerful tooling in modern web applications. Whether you’re a beginner or an advanced developer, refining your TypeScript skills can make a significant difference in your codebase's quality, maintainability, and readability. This guide will walk you through practical tips and best practices to help you write better TypeScript code.

### Why we need to improve TypeScript code more seriously

So there are many built-in solutions in TypeScript in Script which will help you to write bug-free code easily. You need to know these countries and use them in the right way. If we can use them all properly, our journey will become easier.

- ##### Bug reduction : TypeScript helps in catching bugs very quickly while compiling, thus avoiding many errors or bugs at run time.

- ##### High-quality code: TypeScript code is of very high quality and very clean code is easy to observe and very easy to understand.

- ##### Makes collaboration easy: You can easily collaborate in TypeScript at any time. Since TypeScript has its own code structure instructions, developers' code can be easily understood, so collaboration is easy.

### 1.Leverage Strict Typing Options

### 2.Use Types and Interfaces Wisely

### 3.Prefer unknown Over any

### 4.Use Readonly and Immutable Types for Safety

### 5.Define Utility Types for Reusability

### 6.Define Return Types Explicitly

### 7.Handle Null and Undefined Safely

### 8.Utilize Enum for Meaningful Values

### 9.Use never for Exhaustive Checks

### 10.Keep Functions Pure and Concise

### Conclusion

The world of TypeScript is vast, so if you want to explore it further, you need to give enough dedication and research time. You have learned about some of the above topics, I hope these will help you in your development journey at least a little. If you want, you can know better. Technology is constantly being updated from different platforms and programming languages ​​are constantly being updated with technology, so always stay updated with technology.

# Explain the difference between any, unknown, and never types in TypeScript.

### Introduction

To understand TypeScript well, you need to have a good idea about its types. Many of us are a little worried about types. Especially for beginners. Usually there is a lot of confusion about these three major types, Never, unknown, any types. And due to not using these three types correctly, we write a lot of mistakes. This blog will give you a clear idea of ​​the difference between these three.

### Any Type:

Any type is a type system in TypeScript. Using this, you can use any type, there is no specific one, and TypeScript will not assume any type. You can give any value.

- #### Example:

```ts
let anyting: any = 5;
anyting = "Hello";
anyting = true;
anyting.doSometing();
```

### Unknown Type:

Anonymous type is a very useful type in TypeScript. By using anonymous type, you get type safety and it will not return anything until you are sure what the type of your variable is.

- #### Example:

```ts
let notSure: unknown = "typescript";
if (typeof notSure == "string") {
  console.log(notSure.toUpperCase());
}
```

### Never Type:

Never type is a hard type of typescript. Usually, never type will never return anything. Usually, when throwing a custom error, never type has to be used. And sometimes, infinity greed is activated, which never returns anything. In that case, labor type never type is used.

- #### Example:

```ts
funciton throwError(message:string):never{
    return new Error(massage);
}
function infiniteloop():never {
    whil(trure){}
}
```

### Conclusion

Type validation in TypeScript is very important, so we have to be very aware of it so that we can easily utilize our codes properly, especially at the production level. To avoid errors at the production level, we have to think about these types well at the development level.

### Call to Action

So, do you want your code project gulo to be well maintained in these three types, then understand the information well and apply it now. If you like my post, please don't forget to give feedback.
